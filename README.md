# Woot-Hackathon

#

#Project Purpose

At 2017 while i was working at Amazon I joined at an internal Hackathon. 
The participants had 24 hours to develop a game that could represent Woot and use some of their assets (logos, banners and etc)

#Project Description

As I had just a short time to deliver it, I decided to work on a mix of "Pacman" and Pickup Express. 
The player is driving a car through the city and must collect some products that appear randomly at the map, after that the player must deliver those products at the Woot Building.
The challenge here is that some War Tanks might appear at the map and the player must avoid to be "smashed by the thank"

#Considerations

I just worked at this project during those 24 hours, so it`s full of Bugs, what i want to do in the future is create a remake of this project using Web opengl or another Web Based Engine

#Known Bugs

1. UI is not adjusted to the screen size and might appear smaller than what it should be;
2. Some Tanks might be stuck when they spawn in certain parts of the map. I think it must be because of their size and position;
3. Some Products are spawning outside of the road making it impossible to collect;
4. The Car should not stop when you try to turn into a "wall", this can be adjusted with a simple raycast checking if the player will be able to pass through tha direction.
